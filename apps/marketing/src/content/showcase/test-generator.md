The Test Generator workflow reads your source code, plans a comprehensive test suite, and writes tests that actually pass — with a human checkpoint to approve the plan before generation begins.

## How it works

1. **Analyze Source** — A frontier model reads the codebase and identifies all public functions, methods, and types that need test coverage.
2. **Plan Tests** — Generates a structured test plan covering happy paths, edge cases, boundary values, and error conditions.
3. **Human Approval** — The plan is presented for review. You can approve it or send it back for revision.
4. **Generate & Validate** — Tests are written following your project's conventions, then executed. Any failures are automatically fixed in a retry loop.

## Why a workflow beats a single prompt

A single "write tests" prompt often produces tests that don't compile or test the wrong things. By separating analysis, planning, and generation into distinct stages — and adding a human gate — this workflow produces tests that are both comprehensive and correct.
