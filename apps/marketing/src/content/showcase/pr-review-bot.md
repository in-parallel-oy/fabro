The PR Review Bot workflow automates the first pass of code review on every pull request. It fetches the diff, triages files by risk level, performs a deep review on high-risk changes using a frontier model, and posts structured feedback directly on the PR.

## How it works

1. **Fetch Diff** — Pulls the PR diff and full contents of changed files using the GitHub API.
2. **Triage Files** — A fast model categorizes each changed file as high, medium, or low risk based on the type of change (new logic vs. formatting, test files vs. production code).
3. **Deep Review** — A frontier model examines high-risk files for logic errors, security vulnerabilities, race conditions, and style violations.
4. **Post Comments** — Inline comments are posted on specific lines, and a top-level review summary gives an overall verdict.

## Cost optimization

By using a model stylesheet, the workflow routes expensive frontier-model calls only to the deep review stage. File fetching and triaging use a fast, cheap model — keeping the total cost per review under $0.10 for most PRs.
