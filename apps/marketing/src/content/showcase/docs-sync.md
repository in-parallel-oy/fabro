The Docs Sync workflow detects when documentation has drifted from the codebase and automatically updates affected pages — with a human review gate before changes are committed.

## How it works

1. **Get Changes** — Identifies code changes since the last documentation sync using git history.
2. **Scan Docs** — Searches documentation pages for references to changed functions, APIs, types, and features.
3. **Update Docs** — Rewrites affected sections to match the current code, preserving the original writing style and page structure.
4. **Human Review** — Updated pages are presented for review. Approve to commit, or send back for revision.

## Keeping docs honest

Documentation drift is one of the most common sources of developer frustration. This workflow runs on every merge to main, catching drift before it reaches users. Because it understands both the code and the docs, it can make precise, targeted updates rather than generic rewrites.
